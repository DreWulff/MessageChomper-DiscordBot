# Discord Message Chomper
## Description
A Discord bot written in Python made to eat a channel's messages one by one.  
Commands are explained in the [Commands](#discord--commands) section.

**Be careful when setting up the bot's permissions and channels as it will attempt to delete ALL non-pinned messages one by one, unless stopped with the /shut command.**

## Setup
Clone this repository with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/DreWulff/MessageChomper-DiscordBot
```

Make sure all libraries/modules required are installed.
For this either run the bash file `install_modules.bash`, or run the following commands:

    pip install python-dotenv discord.py

Create a `.env` file with the next lines, replacing the values in brackets:
```
#.env
DISCORD_TOKEN=[Token from your Discord bot]
DISCORD_GUILD=[Name of Discord server]
```

To obtain the token you must first have a Discord app/bot. To get started I would recommend to follow the official Discord Developer Portal documentation in [Building your first Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started).

## Run
To start the bot execute the command:
```
python bot.py
```

## Discord `/` Commands
